=begin

Notes:
1- nil is an object that represent nothingness, or another way
to represent the absence of a value, but it still have its own methods
2-every method in Ruby must returns an object and that includes puts,
puts is at the very top level of Ruby.

puts nil

what_is_value_here = puts "Hello"
p what_is_value_here
=begin

what does puts return back to us to assign to this variable?
Well, the puts method returns the object nil. Nil is an object
and it is the object that is returned by the puts method.
The puts methods responsibility is to output text to the screen.
The puts method says I'm going to do this job for you of outputting text,
but what I'm going to give you back is basically an object to
represent, nothing to represent blankness, absence, emptiness,
nothingness. I don't have anything of value to give you back.
