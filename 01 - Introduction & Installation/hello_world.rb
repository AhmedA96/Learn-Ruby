=begin

Notes:
1- Ruby is an OOP language, so everything in it is an object.
2- puts is a method/command used to print out anything on screen.
3- code can be run from termianl using command(ruby file_name).
4- you can use IRB(interactive ruby) also called REPL(Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop)
in the Terminal only for the purpose of testing a code but not saving it, so it is more like
a Temporary playground.
5- object is just a data type.

=end

puts "Hello World"
