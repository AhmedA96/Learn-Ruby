Notes:
1- p method is used to print also as put. But it gives a more detailed
output the same as it is, even the double quotes too.
2- p method is more helpful as it helps you with more details like
if you want to know the data type of the output
3- so p method prints what comes after it as it is in all details.
4- puts, print and p methods are all great methods and there is no one better than
the other, it just depends on what a programmer want to do

puts "Steven Seagal"
p "Steven Seagal"

puts 5   # here we can add a no. to 5
puts "5" # here we can't as it is just a string not a no.

# in the above two lines of code, the output is the same in both
#so you can't tell which one is a number and which one is a string.

# in here, the outputs are different. one is 5 and the other is "5"
p 5
p "5"

puts "Hi there \nline break"
p " Hi there \nline break"
