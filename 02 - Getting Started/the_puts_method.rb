Notes:
1- methods like puts are usually called or invoked, so we usually say
I am invoking/calling a method.
2- calculations can be made inside a puts method.
3- In Ruby, it is recommended if you can run a method without parenthesis,
so you should exclude them for the matter of elegance.
4- always try to distinct between Ruby processing versus Ruby outputting
(3+4) will be processed but won't be printed as an output.
5- puts can be used alone to add a line break, usually puts print what comes
next to it then make a line break automatically. So, puts by itself is a line break.
6- to seperate different outputs on different lines, just use comma after each output
with puts.
