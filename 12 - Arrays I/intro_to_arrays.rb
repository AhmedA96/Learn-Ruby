=begin

Notes:

1- An array is an ordered lis of objects, the word elements is used to describe
itemds inside the array

2- The array itself is an object so it have methods or behaviours as any ruby object.
Like a box in real world, a box can hold multiple objects/items inside of it,
and the box itself is an object too.

3- Ruby can stores data of different types.

=end


numbers = []   # empty array, array initialization
p numbers

nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]  # ruby stores them in this order as they are written from 4 to 42
p nums

things = [4, true, "Hello", 10.9]
p things
